# Welcome to Xicheng Li's Website

I am a Ph.D student in Southern University of Science and Technology.  

My research focuses on chemistry of ozone precursors such as NO<sub>2</sub> (a typical pollutant from human activity such as traffic emissions) and Volatile Organic Compounds (emitted from both plants and industries). 

I use satellite data, chemical transport model and ground-based measurements.

You can find my resume [here](assets/resume/resume.pdf).
